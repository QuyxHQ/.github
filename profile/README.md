# Quyx

Quyx is a social identity platform built on The Open Network (TON), aimed at simplifying and securing the management of your online presence.

Our platform allows users to claim unique usernames through a transparent auction process [here](https://quyx.xyz/claim).

Once a username is secured, users can manage their credentials seamlessly using our Telegram mini app [@QuyxBot](https://t.me/QuyxBot?start). 

This app enables the creation, revocation, and management of credentials, ensuring users have full control over their digital identities.
